# HHICS4U
ICS4U ISU Project
This project was created by 2 students(Anthony Hopkins and Noah Hosein) as a part of
an online course on computer science. It was meant to solve the real world problem of 
tracking and understanding medical data (specifically blood test results). It simulates
a database using XML and populates it based on individual user profiles (set up
through a login page). The program shows a table view, a graph, health suggestions
based on previous data as well as zones (green/yellow/red) for all entities. The 
project took longer than a month and is in the Java language.
