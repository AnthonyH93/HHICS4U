ICS4U ISU Project (Grade 12 Computer Science)

This project was created by 2 students (Anthony Hopkins and Noah Hosein) as a part of an online course on computer science. It was meant to solve the real world problem of tracking and understanding medical data (specifically blood test results). 

Users must first create an account complete with a username and password before logging in for the first time.

Upon launching the application, users are met with an intuitive screen with various default blood results (such as sugar, salt and cholestoral). Users can choose to add entries to these default types of tests using their numerical result along with a date of the test. As data is added, the graph and table views are populated and display the data in an intuitive fashion.

Users can also add new types of tests for specific use cases, they can also add healthy zones for these tests such that the program can identify any areas of concern. These areas of concern would be shown in the health and suggestions screen where a POC of a health bot is present, outputting any irregular or dangerous test results.

All of the users data is stored in a simulated XML database meaning that their data is saved when the logoff and restart the application.
